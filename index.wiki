Hello! Welcome to my digital domain. Click around to learn something new, fun or useful! 

My name is *Carl (Cid) Romero*. I am a *software engineer*. Professionally, my job is to write and maintain quality code, to design elegantly simple solutions for people, and to help those around me accomplish the same — all while *learning* how to do so more effectively *along the way*. Essentially, I strive *to be someone worth turning to* when one feels stuck.

This website is a personal project to share bits about myself and to explore [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS|CSS]], [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML|HTML]] and [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript|JS]]. The latter means this website favors using native features of these technologies over leveraging external libraries and frameworks, but solely in the name of education. There is a time and a place for such extensions, but this website is not one of them — in fact, most websites are not. My [[About#About-Software engineering-Professional experience|professional life]], however, keeps me very engaged in these innovations.

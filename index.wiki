Hello! Welcome to my digital domain. Click around to learn something new, fun or useful! 

My name is *Carl (Cid) Romero*. I am a *software engineer*. Professionally, my job is to write and maintain concise code, to design elegantly simple solutions for people, and to help those around me accomplish the sameâ€”all while *learning along the way* how to do so more effectively. In essence, I strive *to be someone worth turning to* when one feels stuck.

This website is part of my passion project to extend [[https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki|Vimwiki]] into a plugin that Vimmers use to intuitively publish modernized and accessible websites. In my personal time, I strive to meander my way through 'primitive' technology that brings me closer to the 'metal'. Conversely, my [[/about/about#about-software-engineering-professional-experience|professional life]] keeps me immersed in the latest and greatest of the tech world.

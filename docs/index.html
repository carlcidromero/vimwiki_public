This website is a personal project to share bits about myself and to explore CSS, HTML and JS. The latter means this website favors using native features of these technologies over leveraging external libraries and frameworks, but solely in the name of education. There is a time and a place for such extensions, but this website is not one of them- in fact, most websites are not. My professional life, however, keeps me very engaged in these innovations.
